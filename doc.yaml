    <p>It is smart to store the event as %IEvent internally, and expose it as %Listenable externally to deny direct
    control over the event by the clients.</p>
    <pre>
    class Example {
        private _changeEvent = new %Event<number>();

        get changeEvent(): %Listenable<number> {
            return this._changeEvent;
