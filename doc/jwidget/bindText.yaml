      <p>Watches string property modification and updates inner text of the DOM element.</p>

      // Bind inner text to property value
      %bindText(el, text);
      </pre>
      %example:bindText
      <p>The function returns a binding object. If you need to stop the synchronization, %destroy it. This is not neccessary
      if you work with a private property and DOM element as in the example above. However, if you work with an
      external model or DOM element (e.g. they get passed to the constructor of the component), you must take care of
      the binding destruction, because life time of these objects can be longer than the life time of your
      component. The easiest way to do it is to %own the binding:</p>
      <pre>
      this.%own(%bindText(el, text));
      </pre>
