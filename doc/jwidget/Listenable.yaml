      <p>Container for callback functions. Provides basic event listening functionality.</p>
      <p>Has a sub-interface %IEvent, which exposes %trigger method to trigger the event. It is smart to store
      the event as %IEvent internally, and expose it as %Listenable externally to deny direct control over the event
      by the clients.</p>
      <pre>
      class Example {
          private _changeEvent = new %Event<number>();

          get changeEvent(): %Listenable<number> {
              return this._changeEvent;
          }

          // ...

              // We can't trigger public changeEvent, but we can trigger private _changeEvent
              this._changeEvent.%trigger(value);

          // ...

          <p>Whenever the event is %triggered, %handler function is called. Handlers are called in the same order
          as they were bound.</p>
          <p>You can stop listening the event by %destroying the returned object.</p>
