      Interface of %Class - see it for details.

    methods:
      destroy:
        signature: '(): void'
        description: |
          <p>Class destructor invocation method. Destroys all aggregated objects and releases all bindings.
          You must call this method explicitly from outside, because JavaScript doesn't support automatic class
          destructor calling.</p>
          <pre>
          const object = new MyClass();

          // ...

          // Once object is not needed anymore, destroy it
          object.%destroy();
          </pre>
          <p>Alternatively (and optimally), you should use %own method to aggregate this object inside another one.</p>

      own:
        signature: |
          <T extends %Destroyable>(obj: T): T
        params:
          obj: 'Object to aggregate.'
        returns: '%obj'
        description: |
          <p>Aggregates the object. It means that the specified object is automatically destroyed
          on <code>this</code> object destruction. The aggregated objects are destroyed in reverse order.
          Returns %obj object, which makes it easy to use in field definition:</p>
          <pre>
          private selected = this.%own(new %Property(false));
          </pre>

      owning:
        signature: |
          (obj: %Destroyable): this
        params:
          obj: 'Object to aggregate.'
        returns: 'this'
        description: |
          <p>Aggregates the object. It means that the specified object is automatically destroyed
          on <code>this</code> object destruction. The aggregated objects are destroyed in reverse order.
          Returns <code>this</code> object, which makes it easy to use in object instantiation:</p>
          <pre>
          const items = new %List();
          return new Panel(items).%owning(items);
          </pre>
