      Interface of %Class - see it for details.
    methods:
      own:
        signature: |
          <T extends %Destroyable>(obj: T): T
        params:
          obj: 'Object to aggregate.'
        returns: '%obj'
        description: |
          <p>Aggregates the object. It means that the specified object is automatically destroyed
          on %this object destruction. The aggregated objects are destroyed in reverse order.
          Returns %obj object, which makes it easy to use in field definition:</p>
          <pre>
          private selected = %this.%own(new %Property(false));
          </pre>

      owning:
        signature: |
          (obj: %Destroyable): %this
        params:
          obj: 'Object to aggregate.'
        returns: '%this'

          <p>Aggregates the object. It means that the specified object is automatically destroyed
          on %this object destruction. The aggregated objects are destroyed in reverse order.
          Returns %this object, which makes it easy to use in object instantiation:</p>
          <pre>
          const items = new %List();
          return new Panel(items).%owning(items);
          </pre>
