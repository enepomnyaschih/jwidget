      <p>Dummy implementation of %IEvent&lt;any&gt; interface.</p>
      <p>As opposed to %Event, doesn't really bind the event handlers, just pretends it does that. Can be used as a
      lightweight implementation of %IEvent interface if you certainly know that the event should never get triggered.
      Since the application usually involves many events, this can save quite a bit of memory and CPU.</p>
      <p>Based on a boolean <b>dummy</b> argument, you can selectively create a new %Event instance or get %dummyEvent
      via %Event.%make static method.</p>
