    type: '%IHash'
    description: |
      <p>Instance of %IHash singleton. Provides a transparent %Property-compatible interface over <b>location.hash</b>
      manipulations. Has a built-in protection against infinite redirections.</p>

  IHash:
    kind: interface
    extends:
      - file: jwidget/IProperty
        typevars: [string]
    description: |
      <p>Interface of %hash object. Extension of %IProperty&lt;string&gt; interface with %updating status indicator and
      <b>replaceState</b> optional parameter of %set method.</p>
      <p>The built-in implementation of this interface also listens to "hashchange" DOM event to properly update own
      state. It makes this properly transparently mirror current browser <b>location.hash</b> value.</p>
    properties:
      updating:
        modifiers: readonly
        type: boolean
        description: |
          <p>Indicates if hash assignment is in progress at the moment. While %updating is true, <b>location.hash</b>
          gets modified and %changeEvent gets triggered. Checking this flag in corresponding event handlers may prevent
          infinite loops and unexpected callback conflicts.</p>

    methods:
      set:
        signature: |
          (value: string = "", replaceState?: boolean)
        params:
          value: New hash value to assign.
          replaceState: |
            Replace the current browser historical state rather than pushing a new state to the stack.
            Pass this flag on any automated redirection to let browser properly handle "Back" button click.
        description: |
          <p>Assigns <b>location.hash</b> to a new value and triggers %changeEvent. Rises %updating flag to prevent
          infinite loops and callback conflicts during this time.</p>
          <p>Default implementation of this method provides an extra layer of infinite redirection protection. If more
          than 25 redirections occur during 1 second, the property blocks further assignments and writes an error into
          browser console listing all redirections that were supposed to happen.</p>
