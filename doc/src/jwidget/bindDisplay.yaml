      <p>Watches boolean property modification and updates visibility of the DOM element. When %property has %falsy
      value, sets "display" inline style to "none". When %property is %truthy, removes "display" inline style. Make
      sure that the element is visible by default according to your CSS rules.</p>
      <pre>
      // Bind element visibility to property value
      %bindDisplay(el, checked);

      %example:bindDisplay
      <p>The function returns a binding object. If you need to stop the synchronization, %destroy it. This is not neccessary
      if you work with a private property and DOM element as in the example above. However, if you work with an
      external model or DOM element (e.g. they get passed to the constructor of the component), you must take care of
      the binding destruction, because life time of these objects can be longer than the life time of your
      component. The easiest way to do it is to %own the binding:</p>
      <pre>
      this.%own(%bindDisplay(el, checked));
      </pre>
