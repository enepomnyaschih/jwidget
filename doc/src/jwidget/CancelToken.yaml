      <p>Cancellation token is an object that provides a signal on destruction for the bound asynchronous operations to
      stop working. Examples of asynchronous operations that support cancellation are %defer and %request. In comparison
      to "destroyable promise" approach, cancellation tokens are %compatible.</p>
      <pre>
      class Profile extends %Component {

        private cancelToken = this.%own(new %CancelToken());

        protected renderRoot() {
          this.loadProfile();
        }

        private async loadProfile() {
          const profile = await %request($.get("/profile"), this.cancelToken);
          this.el.text(profile.name);
        }
      }
      </pre>
      <p>In the example above, should the component get %destroyed before the %request is finished, it will result in
      request cancellation and the asynchronous code chain interruption.</p>

    constructor:
      signature: |
        ()
      description: |
        Creates cancellation token instance.

    properties:
      canceled:
        modifiers: readonly
        type: boolean
        description: |
          <p>Indicates if the token is already %canceled, i.e. %destroyed. Any operation receiving the canceled token
          should be stopped from calling before being started.</p>

    methods:
      addHandler:
        signature: |
          (handler: () => any, scope?: any): %Destroyable
        params:
          handler: Token cancellation callback.
          scope: '%handler call scope.'
        returns: Handler attachment.
        description: |
          <p>Adds a handler function to call on taken cancellation. If the token is already %canceled, calls the
          function immediately and returns %dummyDestroyable. Else registers the callback for a one-time call on
          token destruction and returns the attachment. Destroying the returned attachment results in handler
          function removal.</p>

      destroy:
        signature: |
          ()
        description: |
          <p>Cancels the token. Calls all registered handler functions. An attempt to add more handler functions
          after the token destruction results in their immediate calling.</p>

  runAsync:
    signature: |
      <T>(run: (resolve: (value?: T | PromiseLike<T>) => void, reject: (error?: any) => void) => void, cancel: () => void, cancelToken?: %CancelToken): %Promise<T>
    params:
      run: Asynchronous operation initiation callback.
      cancel: Asynchronous operation cancellation callback.
      cancelToken: Optional cancellation token.
    returns: Promise representing the operation with cancellation token support.
    description: |
      <p>Helper function that wraps an abstract asynchronous operation with a promise supporting cancellation tokens.
      It follows the next generic algorithm:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>If %cancelToken is not specified, returns a promise that just makes %run call.</li>
      <li>Else if the token is %canceled, returns a promise that does nothing.</li>
      <li>Else returns a promise that makes %run call and also listens for token cancellation. The cancellation is
      handled by %cancel method.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Therefore, %cancel method is never called before %run.</p>
      <p>Please notice that the promise doesn't get resolved or rejected on cancellation. It helps to prevent
      side effects such as error popup displaying. There is no signal on promise cancellation. Since your code is the
      only origin that can trigger token cancellation, you can always implement such a signal for yourself if
      necessary.</p>
      <p>The following code demonstrates how to convert %setTimeout function to a cancelable promise using this
      utility.</p>
      <pre>
      export default function (ms?: number, cancelToken?: %CancelToken) {
          let timeout: any;
          return %runAsync<void>(
              resolve => {
                  timeout = %setTimeout(resolve, ms);
              },
              () => {
                  %clearTimeout(timeout);
              },
              cancelToken
          );
      }
      </pre>
      <p>This is the exact implementation of %defer function.</p>
