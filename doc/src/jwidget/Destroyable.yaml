      Object that has %destroy method. Can be aggregated in an %IClass instance by %own method.

          <p>Class destructor. You must override it in a subclass and call this method explicitly from outside, because
          JavaScript doesn't support automatic class destructor calling.</p>
          <pre>
          const object = new MyClass();

          // ...

          // When the object is not needed anymore, destroy it.
          object.%destroy();
          </pre>
          <p>Alternatively (and optimally), you should use %own method to aggregate this object in another one.</p>
