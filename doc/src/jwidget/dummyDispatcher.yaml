      <p>Dummy implementation of %IDispatcher&lt;any&gt; interface.</p>
      <p>As opposed to %Dispatcher, doesn't really bind any handlers, just pretends it does that. Can be used as a
      lightweight implementation of %IDispatcher interface if you certainly know that a message should never be dispatched.
      Since the application usually involves many messages, this can save quite a bit of resources.</p>
      <p>Based on a boolean <b>dummy</b> argument, you can selectively create a new %Dispatcher instance or get %dummyDispatcher
      via %Dispatcher.%make static method.</p>
