      <p>Base class of UI component. Supports the next features:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Rendering by HTML template.</li>
      <li>Direct access to component elements.</li>
      <li>%jquery interface for element manipulations.</li>
      <li>Convenient API for data binding and child component management.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>jWidget component has very simple API, but pretty unusual philosophy to build up Model-View architecture
      without a lot of effort. Let's start with examples.</p>

    topics:
      example:
        header: jWidget UI component example
        text: |
          <pre>
          @%templateAnnotation(
              '<div jwclass="my-component">' +
                  '<div jwid="hello-message"></div>' +
                  '<a href="#" jwid="link">Click me!</a>' +
              '</div>'
          )
          class MyComponent extends %Component {
              constructor(private message: string, private link: string) {
                  super();
              }

              protected %afterRender() {
                  super.%afterRender();
                  this.%getElement("hello-message").text(this.message);
                  this.%getElement("link").attr("href", this.link);
              }
          }
          </pre>
          %example:component
          <p>Let's find out how the HTML template works. Each component has a template, that is passed into %templateAnnotation
          annotation and defaults to <tt>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</tt>. Subclass inherits the superclass template.</p>
          <p>Pay attention to special attributes %jwclass and %jwid in the template. %jwclass is a root
          CSS class of the component, and %jwid is a suffix to %jwclass in this element. So, the next HTML snippet is
          created in DOM as a result of this component rendering:</p>
          <pre>
          <div class="my-component">
              <div class="my-component-hello-message"></div>
              <a href="#" class="my-component-link">Click me!</a>
          </div>
          </pre>
          <p>You can obtain an element by its %jwid via method %getElement. The result of this method is a %jquery wrapper
          over this element. The root element always has jwid = "root". In addition, the root element of the component is
          stored in %el property of the component.</p>

      creation:
        header: Component creation in code
        text: |
          <p>Component can be created by simple construction of component object. After that, you can use one of the
          methods %render, %renderTo, %renderAs to render this component and optionally insert it into DOM.
          <pre>
          $(() => {
              new MyComponent("Hello, World!", "javascript:alert('Hello!')").%renderTo("body");
          });
          </pre>

      childComponents:
        header: Child components
        text: |
          <p>There are 5 ways to add a child component (<b>note</b>: examples are not complete - see %componentRemoval.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p>Add a child component into %children map with a key equal to jwid of the element to replace with the child
          component. Usually it is done in %afterRender method.</p>
          <pre>
          %afterRender() {
              super.%afterRender();
              this.%children.%setOfMap("label", new LabelView("Hello"));
          }
          </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Add a bindable child component using %addBindable method. Pass an instance of %Bindable&lt;%Component&gt;
          as an argument and the component will provide the synchronization with this property during application
          running.</p>
          <pre>
          %afterRender() {
              super.%afterRender();
              this.contentView = new %Property(new LabelView("Hello"));
              this.%addBindable(this.contentView, "label");
          }

          changeLabel(value: string) {
              this.contentView.%propertySet(new LabelView(value));
          }
          </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Add an array of child components into some element using %addArray method. Pass an instance of
          %ReadonlyBindableArray&lt;%Component&gt; as an argument and the component will provide the synchronization
          with this array during application running.</p>
          <pre>
          %afterRender() {
              super.%afterRender();
              this.labelViews = new %BindableArray([new LabelView("one"), new LabelView("two")]);
              this.%addArray(this.labelViews, "labels");
          }

          addLabel(value: string) {
              this.labelViews.%arrayAdd(new LabelView(value));
          }
          </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Add a set of child components into some element using %addSet method. As opposed to %addArray
          method, %addSet doesn't let you control the order of child components. A newly added component is always appended
          to the end. Framework will provide the synchronization with this set during application running.</p>
          <pre>
          %afterRender() {
              super.%afterRender();
              this.labelViews = new %BindableSet([new LabelView("one"), new LabelView("two")]);
              this.%addSet(this.labelViews, "labels");
          }

          addLabel(value: string) {
              this.labelViews.%setAdd(new LabelView(value));
          }
          </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Define method <b>render&lt;ChildId&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;ChildId&gt;</b> is jwid of an element in CamelCase with
          capitalized first letter. Example: <b>renderArticle</b> renders the element with jwid = "article". If the method
          returns an instance of %Component, %Bindable, %ReadonlyBindableArray or %ReadonlyBindableSet, then result will be
          treated as a child component or a child component array/collection. Define method <b>renderRoot</b> to render the
          root element, but you can return only %ReadonlyBindableArray or %ReadonlyBindableSet there, because it is
          impossible to replace the root element of the component.</p>
          <pre>
          protected renderLabel() {
              return new LabelView("Hello");
          }
          </pre>
          <p>See %moreAboutRender paragraph for details.</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Such API provides simplicity, at one hand, and flexibility in Model-View regard, at another hand.</p>
          <p>Reference: %tutorial1</p>

      childComponentCollections:
        header: More about child component collections
        text: |
          <p>It is convenient to use %startMappingArray and %startMappingSet functions to convert data collections
          to UI component collections. Thanks to them, view is updated on data update automatically.</p>
          <p>That's the reason why we recommend to use jWidget collections in data model instead of native JavaScript Array
          and %Set: jWidget collections can be synchronized to each other.</p>
          <p>Reference: %tutorial6</p>

      moreAboutRender:
        header: More about renderChildId methods
        text: |
          <p>You can define method <b>render&lt;ChildId&gt;</b> for any element in HTML template that has attribute jwid.
          <b>&lt;ChildId&gt;</b> equals to this jwid, written in CamelCase with capitalized first letter.
          Method signature:</p>
          <pre>
          protected renderChildId(el: %JQuery): %Renderable
          </pre>
          <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-lg-2 col-sm-3">el</dt><dd class="col-lg-10 col-sm-9">Element with corresponding jwid.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Depending on the returned value of this method, you have the next options:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>If the method returns an instance of %Component, then it gets added into %children map and becomes a child
          component. This option doesn't work for the root element.</li>
          <li>If the method returns an instance of %Bindable&lt;%Component&gt;, then it gets added as a bindable child
          component via %addBindable method. This option doesn't work for the root element.</li>
          <li>If the method returns an instance of %ReadonlyBindableArray&lt;%Component&gt;, then it gets added as a child array via
          method %addArray.</li>
          <li>If the method returns an instance of %ReadonlyBindableSet&lt;%Component&gt;, then
          it gets added as a child collection via method %addSet.</li>
          <li>If the method returns <b>false</b>, then the element gets removed from the HTML document. This option doesn't
          work for the root element.</li>
          <li>In any other case, the component doesn't perform any additional actions with the element. You can use
          <b>el</b> argument to do arbitrary manipulations over it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The method should be protected, not private, to avoid "unused method" warning of TypeScript compiler.</p>

      componentRemoval:
        header: Component removal and destruction
        text: |
          <p>You can destroy a component via %destroy method. However you can not destroy a component which is added into
          another component as a child (component throws an exception in this case). You must remove the child component
          from its parent first. To remove the component from its parent, you must perform the operation opposite to the
          adding operation.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>If you have added a component to %children object, you must remove it via %mapDelete method.</li>
          <li>Methods %addBindable, %addArray and %addSet return bindings. Their destruction removes the
          children.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As soon as a child component is removed, you can destroy it:</p>
          <pre>
          this.children.%mapDelete("comments").%destroy();
          </pre>
          <p>For collections, you should do something like this (<b>note</b>: this code is not optimal, see the example
          below):</p>
          <pre>
          // should be called after the rendering initiation
          initLabels() {
              // Map label data array to view array
              this._labelViews = %startMappingArray(this.labels, label => new LabelView(label), {%destroy});

              // Add labels into element with jwid="labels"
              this._labelArray = this.%addArray(this._labelViews, "labels");
          }

          clearLabels() {
              this._labelArray.%destroy();
              this._labelArray = null;
              this._labelViews.%destroy();
              this._labelViews = null;
          }
          </pre>
          <p>You don't need to remove the child components explicitly all the time. On parent component destruction,
          it automatically removes all the children before %unrender method call. However, it doesn't destroy them.
          You can use aggregation method %own to destroy child components. So, usually your code will look as simple as
          this:</p>
          <pre>
          renderTitleBox() {
              return this.%own(new TitleBox());
          }

          renderLabels() {
              return this.%own(%startMappingArray(this.labels, label => new LabelView(label), {%destroy}));
          }
          </pre>

      commonPractices:
        header: Common practices in child component management

          <h6>Create a child component</h6>
          <p>This example describes how to create and destroy a child component with <tt>jwid="title-box"</tt>.</p>
          <pre>
          @%templateAnnotation(
              '<div jwclass="my-component">' +
                  '<div jwid="title-box"></div>' +
              '</div>'
          )
          class MyComponent extends %Component {
              protected renderTitleBox() {
                  return this.%own(new TitleBox());
              }
          }
          </pre>
          <h6>Create a bindable child component</h6>
          <p>This example describes how to create and destroy a bindable child component with <tt>jwid="document"</tt>.
          Assume that you have an observable property "document" and want to replace an old document view with a new one on
          document change.</p>
          <pre>
          @%templateAnnotation(
              '<div jwclass="my-component">' +
                  '<div jwid="document"></div>' +
              '</div>'
          )
          class MyComponent extends %Component {
              constructor(private document: %Bindable<Document>) {
                  super();
              }

              protected renderDocument() {
                  return this.%own(this.document.%mapProperty(document => new DocumentView(document), {%destroy}));
              }
          }
          </pre>
          <h6>Create a child component collection</h6>
          <p>This example describes how to create and destroy child components by data collection, and insert them into
          element with <tt>jwid="labels"</tt>. If data collection is not silent, child component collection gets constantly
          synchronized with the data.</p>
          <pre>
          @%templateAnnotation(
              '<div jwclass="my-component">' +
                  '<div jwid="labels"></div>' +
              '</div>'

          class MyComponent extends %Component {
              constructor(private labels: %ReadonlyBindableArray<Label>) {
                  super();
              }

              protected renderLabels() {
                  return this.own(%startMappingArray(this.labels, label => new LabelView(label), {%destroy));
              }
          }
          </pre>
          <h6>Add existing components as children</h6>
          <p>This example describes how to insert child components which have lifetime controlled by someone else, and
          therefore shouldn't be destroyed by parent component.</p>
          <pre>
          @%templateAnnotation(
              '<div jwclass="my-component">' +
                  '<div jwid="title-box"></div>' +
              '</div>'
          )
          class MyComponent extends %Component {
              constructor(private titleBox: %Renderable) {
                  super();
              }

              protected renderTitleBox() {
                  return this.titleBox;
              }
          }
          </pre>

      componentLifeStages:
        header: Component life stages
        text: |
          <p>Each component has several stages of life.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Like in all other classes, <b>constructor</b> is called first. Usually all fields are assigned to their
          initial values here, messages are created etc. Only component model should be touched here, view is completely
          ignored. Notice that component is not rendered after construction yet, so it doesn't have fields %el and
          %children assigned, and methods %addArray, %addSet, %addBindable won't work. The main reason behind that is
          our wish to give you a possibility to do something else between component construction and rendering, for example,
          change some field values and call some methods. Second reason: it is not recommended to call virtual methods in
          constructor in any object-oriented language. It may result in undesired side effects. You can render the
          component directly by calling %render, %renderTo, %renderAs, or by adding this component into another component
          as a child. For example, component gets rendered immediately once it gets added to %children map. You can invoke
          component rendering multiple times, but it gets rendered only once.</li>
          <li>Component rendering flow:<ol>
            <li>Method %createElement is called to create the HTML elements by the template.</li>
            <li>The links to all elements are assigned.</li>
            <li>Method %beforeRender is called. It is convenient to perform some preliminary actions here. You are already
            able to create child components. Call <tt>super.beforeRender()</tt> at the first line of the method.</li>
            <li>All %renderChildId methods are called for HTML template elements. The methods are called in the same order as
            these jwid's are written in the template.</li>
            <li>Method %afterRender is called at the end of rendering procedure. You should assign all elements' attributes
            here, create child components, bind event handlers and fill the component with interactivity. Component rendering
            is finished here. Call <tt>super.afterRender()</tt> at the first line of the method.</li>
          </ol></li>
          <li>Method %afterAppend is called once the component first time appears in HTML DOM and UI component tree.
          Component layouting should be performed here (i.e. element size computation). Call <tt>super.afterAppend()</tt>
          at the first line of the method.</li>
          <li>Component destruction flow:<ol>
            <li>If the component was in DOM, %releaseDom method is called. Everything that was performed in %afterAppend
            method, i.e. on step 3, should be reverted here. Call <tt>super.releaseDom()</tt> at the last line of the
            method.</li>
            <li>The element is removed from DOM. All child components are removed. All child arrays, sets and
            properties are unbound.</li>
            <li>If the component was rendered, %unrender method is called. Everything that was performed during component
            rendering, i.e. on step 2, should be reverted here. You must destroy the child components explicitly here unless
            you use %own method to aggregate them. Call <tt>super.unrender()</tt> at the last line of the method.</li>
            <li>The element is destroyed, i.e. all event handlers and data assigned to the element is released.</li>
            <li>Method %afterDestroy is called. Nearly everything that was performed in component
            constructor, i.e. on step 1, should be reverted here. Call <tt>super.afterDestroy()</tt> at the last line of the
            method.</li>
            <li>All aggregated objects (including child components) are destroyed.</li>
            <li>Method %destroyObject is called. Call <tt>super.destroyObject()</tt> at the last line of the method.</li>
          </ol>
          It implies that you should never override %destroy method for a %Component.</li>
          </ol>

      webPackIntegration:
        header: Integration with WebPack
        text: |
          <p>There's an easy way to attach HTML templates via WebPack. The first example from this topic can be splitted
          into two files:</p>

          <p>To make this work, you need to install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-loader"
          target="_blank">html-loader</a> NPM module:</li>
          <pre>
          npm install --save-dev html-loader
          </pre>
          <p>And use it in WebPack configuration:</p>
          <pre>
          module: {
              rules: [
                  // ...
                  { test: /\.html$/, loader: "html-loader", query: {minimize: true, attrs: false} }
              ]
          }
          </pre>
          <p>Also, you need to provide TypeScript compiler with <b>require</b> method semantics. Just create a globals.d.ts
          file somewhere in sources folder with the next lines of code:</p>
          <pre>
          // hack to make this a module
          // @ts-ignore
          export default null;

          // hack to use CommonJS syntax in TypeScript files (e.g. to load CSS)
          // https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#loading-other-resources-and-code-splitting
          declare global {
              const require: {
                  <T>(path: string): T;
                  (paths: string[], callback: (...modules: any[]) => void): void;
                  ensure: (paths: string[], callback: (require: <T>(path: string) => T) => void) => void;
              };
          }
          </pre>

        description: |
          <p>Adds child component and synchronizes the component with the property. On every property change, removes
          the child and adds another one. Equivalent to returning a %Bindable&lt;%Component&gt; instance in rendering

              this.%addBindable(avatarView, "avatar");
          }
          </pre>
          <p>%addBindable method returns a binding. If you %baseDestroy it, the child gets removed from parent component
          and the synchronization gets stopped. The same happens when the component gets destroyed -
          right before %unrender method call. But notice that child component inside this
          property does not get destroyed automatically. Usually it can be done by corresponding %Mapper or %Property
          destruction in %unrender method or via %own.

          data array using %startMappingArray utility:</p>

          }
          </pre>
          <p>%addArray method returns a binding. If you %baseDestroy it, the children get removed from parent component
          and the synchronization gets stopped. The same happens when the component gets destroyed -
          right before %unrender method call. But notice that child components inside this array are not
          destroyed automatically. Usually it can be done by corresponding %ArrayMapper or array destruction in
          %unrender method or via %own.</p>
      addSet:

        description: |
          <p>Adds a set of child components and synchronizes the component with it. On every set change,
          adds or removes corresponding children. Equivalent to returning a %ReadonlyBindableSet&lt;%Component&gt;
          instance in rendering method. As opposed to %addArray method, ignores component order.
          It is convenient to create "source" collection from data collection using %startMappingSet utility:</p>
          <pre>
          protected %afterRender() {

              const set = this.%own(%startMappingSet(this.users, user => new UserView(user), {%destroy}));
              this.%addSet(set, "users");
          }
          </pre>
          <p>%addSet method returns a binding. If you %baseDestroy it, the children get removed from parent
          component and the synchronization gets stopped. The same happens when the component gets destroyed -
          right before %unrender method call. But notice that child components inside
          this set are not destroyed automatically. Usually it can be done by corresponding mapper or
          set destruction in %unrender method or via %own.</p>

        description: |
          <p>Selects component rendering strategy. This method is needed only in very rare cases. By default,
          component is rendered outside of DOM based on %template property.
          You can change this by passing one of the next values into %using method of the component:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>%AbstractTemplate or string - use this template explicitly for rendering.</li>
          <li>HTMLElement or %JQuery - build component on top of existing DOM element. Special attributes jwclass and
          jwid get processed in the usual way.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Note:</b> We strongly encourage you to use standard rendering strategy via %template, or at least
          create %HtmlTemplate instances to store your HTML templates. They work 3 times faster compared to raw HTML
          rendering thanks to preliminary compilation and node cloning method.</p>
      beforeRender:
        modifiers: protected
        signature: 'beforeRender()'
        description: |
          <p>Component life stage method. Called during component rendering after HTML template parsing and
          initialization of references to all elements of the template. Called before %renderChildId methods and
          %afterRender method. It is convenient to perform some preliminary action here before child component
          creation. But you are already able to create child components here. Call <tt>super.beforeRender()</tt> at
          the first line of the method.</p>
      afterRender:
        modifiers: protected
        signature: 'afterRender()'
        description: |
          <p>Component life stage method. Called after %beforeRender method and %renderChildId methods. You should
          assign all elements' attributes here, create child components, bind to events and fill component with
          interactivity. Call <tt>super.afterRender()</tt> at the first line of the method.</p>
      afterAppend:
        modifiers: protected
        signature: 'afterAppend()'
        description: |
          <p>Component life stage method. Called after first-time component appearing in HTML DOM and UI components
          tree. Component layouting should be performed here (element size computing). Component rendering is
          finished here. Call <tt>super.afterAppend()</tt> at the first line of the method.</p>
          <p><b>Caution:</b> the method is called in the next cases only:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>%renderTo or %renderAs method is called, and the parent element is present in the document body.</li>
            <li>The component is added as a child component to a component that has %afterAppend method called
            in the past.</li>
            <li>This is a child component of a component that has %afterAppend called at the moment.</li>
            <li>%render method is called, and %using method was called with an HTMLElement or %jquery element passed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In other words, %afterAppend method works as expected as long as you render child components as specified
          in %childComponents topic.</p>
      releaseDom:
        modifiers: protected
        signature: 'releaseDom()'
        description: |
          <p>Component life stage method. Called during component destruction before %unrender method call.
          Everything that was performed in %afterAppend method should be reverted here. Call
          <tt>super.releaseDom()</tt> at the last line of the method.</p>
      unrender:
        modifiers: protected
        signature: 'unrender()'
        description: |
          <p>Component life stage method. Called during component destruction before %afterDestroy method call.
          Everything that was performed during component rendering should be reverted here. All child components are
          already removed by the component before this method call, but the components themselves are not destroyed. You
          must destroy them explicitly as specified in %componentRemoval topic. Call <tt>super.unrender()</tt> at the
          last line of the method.</p>
      afterDestroy:
        modifiers: protected
        signature: 'afterDestroy()'
        description: |
          <p>Component life stage method. Called during component destruction after %unrender method call. Everything
          that was performed during component construction should be reverted here. Call <tt>super.afterDestroy()</tt>
          at the last line of the method.</p>
      createElement:
        modifiers: protected
        signature: 'createElement(): %TemplateOutput'
        returns: HTML template rendering output.
        description: |
          <p>Virtual method to render the component document fragment. By default, renders by %template.</p>
